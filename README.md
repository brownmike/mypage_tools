# MypageTools

A work in progress. Very primitive right now.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'mypage_tools'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mypage_tools

## Requirements

For now you need [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) and [Ruby 2.0](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or greater installed.

If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed you can just

		$ brew install phantomjs

## Usage

		$ mypage

## TODO:
+ Automagically handle PhantomJS dependency
+ Output to one .ics file starting from the first day you don't have a schedule for
+ Write tests! :-X
